          %p The Swim Shorts Film Festival seeks to celebrate our Northeast Florida's waterways through short film submissions. We invite filmmakers of all ages and ability levels to send us a short film about or set in Northeast Florida's waters. All proceeds from the festival, including ticket sales and dontaions, will go to the St. John's Riverkeeper organization for use in their public awareness and conservation efforts. There is no entry fee for submissions to the festival.

          %p A panel of volunteer judges will select the best entries from each age group, and we will screen the winners at the festival showcase at Sun Ray Cinemas on August 18, 2016. Additionally, creators of the top entries will receive prizes donated from local businesses.
